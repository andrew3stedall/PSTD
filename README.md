# PSTD

PSTD is a Rust-first tool for extracting email data from Microsoft Outlook PST files. The immediate objective is reliable, evidence-backed PST conversion coverage. Downstream Snowflake, search, UI, analytics, and graph work remain parked until extraction fidelity is substantially broader.

## Current position

_Last reviewed: 14 July 2026._

| Area | State on `main` | Current result |
|---|---|---|
| Product foundation | Complete through M25 | Rust CLI, Python wrapper, Docker packaging, structured TAR/JSONL output, batch/resume support, diagnostics, and operator guidance. |
| Parser-quality sequence | Complete through PQ74 | Bounded PST traversal, Heap-on-Node/BTH/Table Context parsing, validated row transport, fixed-width value decoding, and production diagnostics. |
| Vertical extraction sequence | Complete through Vertical 13 / PR #429 | Four row-aligned recipient records can retain recipient role, display name, address, and authoritative address kind without partial or heuristic assembly. |
| Active implementation | Draft PR #430, not part of `main` | Projects display names and preferred addresses from the same validated rows and heap in one invocation. Its current CI state must be checked on the PR before it is treated as merged capability. |
| EML reconstruction | Not implemented | Canonical output remains structured TAR + JSONL. |

## Intent

PSTD is intended to become a dependable PST-to-email extraction engine that:

- preserves folder and message relationships;
- extracts message metadata, bodies, recipients, threading data, and attachments;
- fails closed when a PST structure is unsupported or ambiguous;
- records explicit diagnostics instead of silently guessing;
- produces deterministic structured output suitable for later EML generation or downstream loading;
- validates every material parser change against synthetic tests and an approved public PST fixture.

## Validated public-fixture evidence

The checked-in public PST is the primary end-to-end progress signal. The current stable baseline is:

| Metric | Validated result |
|---|---:|
| BBT entries | 50 |
| NBT entries | 63 |
| Folders | 11 |
| True message candidates | 1 |
| Extracted messages | 1 |
| Body payloads | 2 |
| Attachments emitted | 0 |
| Selected properties | 16 |
| Unknown properties | 19 |

The Table Context path now validates four 52-byte rows. The fixture has separately produced:

- recipient roles: `to`, `to`, `cc`, `cc`;
- display names: `Recipient 1` through `Recipient 4`;
- native email-address values: `to1@domain.com`, `to2@domain.com`, `cc1@domain.com`, and `cc2@domain.com`.

On `main`, these values can be assembled into complete row-aligned recipient records when the validated diagnostics are supplied together. Production reporting does not yet publish the complete records from one public-fixture execution.

## Progress over time

| Phase | Outcome |
|---|---|
| M1-M25 | Built the local/Docker product foundation, command surface, structured output contract, batch operations, diagnostics, and handoff documentation. |
| PQ1-PQ35 | Corrected root and index traversal, identified real folders/messages, investigated property and subnode paths, and replaced invalid table assumptions with measured evidence. |
| PQ36 | Produced the first major fidelity improvement by decoding permitted blocks, rejecting false table declarations, recovering text/RTF bodies, and reducing unknown properties. |
| PQ37-PQ57 | Resolved the real Table Context heap, row-index BTH, subnode-backed row storage, four 52-byte rows, and exact bounded bitmap masks. |
| PQ58-PQ74 | Validated descriptor mapping, constructed bounded row transport, decoded supported fixed-width MAPI values, and integrated fail-closed diagnostics into production reporting. |
| Vertical 1-13 | Progressed from classifying a real recipient property to extracting recipient roles, names, addresses, address kinds, and complete row-aligned recipient records. |

Detailed point-in-time milestone and experiment records are retained under `docs/`. They are historical evidence, not the current roadmap.

## What works

```text
pstd version
pstd inspect --input <pst-file>
pstd inspect --input <pst-file> --json
pstd extract --input <pst-file> --output <output-dir>
pstd batch --input <pst-file-or-directory> --output <output-dir>
python -m pstd --help
```

Implemented capabilities include bounded parsing of PST headers, BBT/NBT pages, blocks, subnodes, Heap-on-Node allocations, BTH structures, Property Contexts, Table Contexts, row storage, selected MAPI values, folder/message candidates, bodies, recipient evidence, structured outputs, batch state, and public-fixture diagnostics.

## Important limitations

PSTD is not yet a general-purpose or absolute-coverage PST-to-EML converter. Current evidence is fixture-limited. Attachment output remains zero on the public fixture, complete recipient records are not yet emitted through the production reporting path in one run, and uncommon/corrupt PST layouts remain incomplete. Do not infer broad compatibility from the milestone count.

## Validation gate

```text
cargo fmt --check
cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings
cargo test --all
cargo run -- --help
cargo run -- version
cargo run -- inspect --help
cargo run -- batch --help
python -m pstd --help
docker build -t pstd:local -f docker/Dockerfile .
```

Approved fixtures must also pass inspect, extract, batch, and deterministic public-progress artifact checks. Never commit private PST data.
